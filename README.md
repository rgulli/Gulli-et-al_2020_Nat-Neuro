## Overview

This directory hosts the data that was analyzed and included in Gulli, Duong, Corrigan, Doucet, Williams, Fusi & Martinez-Trujillo, Nature Neuroscience (in press). 

For code used to process and analyze this data, please email Roberto Gulli. 


## Example neurons

In **Fig. 1c**, six example neurons are shown with spikes overlaid on trajectories through the virtual reality environment. 

Data from these neurons used to generate these plots can be found in the directory `example_neurons`.


## Spatial information content and spatial firing fields

**Fig. 1d** reports spatial information content for the population of hippocampal neurons recorded in each task. 

### From the manuscript Methods: 
The specificity of each neuron’s spatial response map was quantified using spatial information content(31, 53) (Figure 1E). Each neuron’s information content (I; in bits) is defined as

(INSERT EQ 1 HERE)

where the average firing rate per pixel (BAR LAMBDA) for each neuron can be accessed in the directory `firing_rate_maps`.


## Spatial response fields
**Fig. 2** shows the number of neurons with a significantly elevated firing rate for each pixel of the maze in each task. All data presented in this figure is derived from the significance maps included in the `significance_maps` directory. These data are organized such that data indices correspond with the average firing rate maps of the previous section. 


## Spatial decoding analyses

**Fig. 3** shows the spatial decoding accuracy using both an allocentric and direction-dependent reference frame, using hippocampal data collected while monkeys completed the X-Maze in both tasks.  

Files containing data for these analyses can be found in the `spatial_decoding` directory. 


## Trial type encoding and decoding analyses
